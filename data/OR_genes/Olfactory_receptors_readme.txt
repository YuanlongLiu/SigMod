	##	Gene Family: Olfactory receptors (OR)
	##	downloaded by Yuanlong LIU, 01-08-2017
	##	The genes of the OR gene family form a hug hairball structure (a set of genes with many interconnections) in the STRING network. It can hamper the power of the SigMod method. We suggest to remove these genes from the STRING network if they are apparently irrelevant to the phenotype under study
